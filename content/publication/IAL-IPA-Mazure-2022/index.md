abstract: Anthropogenic land use changes and hydroclimate fluctuations are generally described as the main control factors of soil erosion on centennial to millennial time scales, but their relative contribution on erosion trends is barely quantified yet. While past erosion dynamics can be inferred from lake sediment records, improvements in land surface models now allow the quantification of soil erosion on a variety of spatial scales ranging from plot to regional or even global scales. However, application of model approaches to long timescales is still at its dawn, limiting quantification of past soil erosion, investigation of scenarios, interpolation of data spatially and temporally, or testing hypothesis. Here we show how coupling paleo-environmental data and spatially distributed models of soil loss constrained by land cover data might help to assess past soil erosion dynamics and to quantify soil loss exports.
