PhD in geosciences, my research project is to study long-term soil erosion dynamics and associated carbon exports by coupling numerical models and paleo-environmental data.

Concerning my personal projects, I am part of the French band [Veliocasses](https://veliocasses.bandcamp.com/album/seluanos-bona-ep) as musician.
